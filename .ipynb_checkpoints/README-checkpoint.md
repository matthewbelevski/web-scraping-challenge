# web-scraping-challenge

The goal for this assignment was to build a web application using Flask that could scrape through 4 websites collecting various information such as text, images and tables and then displaying all this onto a HTML page.

To first scrape the data, Python in combination with BeautifulSoup and Splinter were needed to be able to browse through the various websites and save the relevent data from the HTML code to variables.

The relevant variables were then to be saved inside a Mongo database to then be displayed on the HTML page.
